The workflow follows the "simple way" of reducing calibrations from the
\instrument\ Pipeline User Manual. That is it makes use of the TW-table from the
CalibDB and runs a single recipe for each of: darks, flats, wavecal and science
reduction.

\section{Quick Start: Reducing The Demo Data \label{sec:quick_start}}

The content of demo data sets are described in Table \ref{tab:demodata}.
Digits in the brackets give the number of raw frames of the given type.
Some calibration files are shared among multiple datasets.

For the user who is keen on starting reductions without being
distracted by detailed documentation, we describe the steps to be
performed to reduce the science data provided in the \instname\, demo
data set 
supplied with the \reflex\ {\tt \reflexvers} release. By following these
steps, the user should have enough information to perform a reduction
of his/her own data without any further reading:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First, type:
        \begin{verbatim}
        esoreflex -l
        \end{verbatim}

    If the \reflex\ executable is not in your path, then you have
      to provide the command with the executable full path {\tt
        <install\_dir>/bin/esoreflex -l }. For convenience, we will
      drop the reference to {\tt <install\_dir>}. A list with the
      available \reflex\ workflows will appear, showing the workflow
      names and their full path.

   \item Open the \wkfname\ by typing:

\bigskip

      {\tt \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ esoreflex} \wkfn {\tt \&}

\bigskip

      Alternatively, you can type only the command \reflex\, the empty
      canvas will appear (Figure~\ref{fig:reflex_empty}) and you can
      select the workflow to open by clicking on {\tt File -> Open
        File}. Note that the loaded workflow will appear in a new
      window. The \wkfname\ workflow is shown in
      Figure~\ref{fig:pipe_wkf_layout}. 

  \item To aid in the visual tracking of the reduction cascade, it is advisable
  to use component (or actor) highlighting. Click on {\tt Tools -> Animate at
  Runtime}, enter the number of milliseconds representing the animation
  interval (100\,ms is recommended), and click \fbox{\tt OK}.

\item Change directories set-up. Under ``Setup Directories'' in the
  workflow canvas there are seven parameters that specify important
  directories (green dots).

  By default, the {\tt ROOT\_DATA\_DIR}, which specifies the working
  directory within which the other directories are organised. is set
  to your {\tt \$HOME/reflex\_data} directory. All the temporary and
  final products of the reduction will be organized under
  sub-directories of {\tt ROOT\_DATA\_DIR}, therefore make sure this
  parameter points to a location where there is enough disk space. To
  change {\tt ROOT\_DATA\_DIR}, double click on it and a pop-up window
  will appear allowing you to modify the directory string, which you
  may either edit directly, or use the \fbox{\tt Browse} button to
  select the directory from a file browser.  When you have finished,
  click \fbox{\tt OK} to save your changes.

    Changing the value of {\tt RAW\_DATA\_DIR} is the only necessary
    modification if you want to process data other than the demo data

  \item Click the 
  \includegraphics[width=0.5cm,height=0.5cm]{reflex_run_button.png}
  button to start the workflow

\item The workflow will highlight the {\tt Data Organiser} actor which
  recursively scans the raw data directory (specified by the parameter
  {\tt RAW\_DATA\_DIR} under ``Setup Directories'' in the workflow
  canvas) and constructs the datasets. Note that the raw and static
  calibration data must be present either in {\tt RAW\_DATA\_DIR} or
  in {\tt CALIB\_DATA\_DIR}, otherwise datasets may be incomplete and
  cannot be processed. However, if the same reference file was
  downloaded twice to different places this creates a problem as
  \reflex\ cannot decide which one to use.

\item The {\tt Data Set Chooser} actor will be highlighted next and
  will display a ``Select Datasets'' window that lists the datasets
  along with the values of a selection of useful header
  keywords\footnote{The keywords listed can be changed by double
    clicking on the {\tt DataOrganiser} Actor and editing the list of
    keywords in the second line of the pop-up window. Alternatively,
    instead of double-clicking, you can press the right mouse button
    on the {\tt DataOrganiser} Actor and select {\tt Configure Actor} to
    visualize the pop-up window.}.  The first column consists of a set
  of tick boxes which allow the user to select the datasets to be
  processed. By default all complete datasets which have not yet been
  reduced will be selected.

  \item Click the \fbox{\tt Continue} button and watch the progress of
    the workflow by following the red highlighting of the actors. A
    window will show which dataset is currently being processed.

\ifdefined \instquickitemlist 
  \input{\instquickitemlist}
\fi

\item Once the reduction of all datasets has finished, a pop-up window
  called {\sl Product Explorer} will appear, showing the datasets
  which have been reduced together with the list of final products.
  This actor allows the user to inspect the final data products, as
  well as to search and inspect the input data used to create any of
  the products of the workflow.

\item After the workflow has finished, all the products from all the
  datasets can be found in a directory under {\tt END\_PRODUCTS\_DIR}
  named after the workflow start timestamp. Further subdirectories
  will be found with the name of each dataset.

\end{enumerate}

Well done! You have successfully completed the quick start section and
you should be able to use this knowledge to reduce your own
data. However, there are many interesting features of {\tt Reflex} and
the \instname\, workflow that merit a look at the rest of this tutorial.

\section{Troubleshooting}

\putgraph{12.5cm}{NoDataSet.png}{NoDataSet}
{TheDataOrganizer interactive window reports an error 
  ``:No DataSets have been created, check the data set and the OCA rules.''}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\bf I downloaded the data from the ESO archive, put them into
  a new directory, tried to run {\tt Reflex} on them, but}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf it crashes}

The current release of the FORS pipeline includes some additional data in the static
calibration frames. The recipes would choke if this data is not present. 
However, the ESO archive with CalSelector may associate calibration data which
is old and Reflex will pick the files either from the installed pipeline
static data or from the CalSelector in a non-deterministic way. In order to 
solve the issue, remove the static calibration data downloaded from the archive
(all the files starting with M.FORS2).

This may happen if one of the files was downloaded only partially
(check for a file with the extension {\tt fits.Z.part}. You will have to
download that file again in order to have an uncorrrupted file (and
remove the partial one).

\item {\bf The DataOrganiser fails with the error message 
 ``:No DataSets have been created, check the data set and the OCA rules.''(see
  Figure \ref{fig:NoDataSet}.)}

This error may be due to the fact that the data provided by the ESO
archive are compressed\\ ({\tt <filename>.fits.Z}).  Please 
remember to uncompress the data before running the workflow in 
{\tt Reflex}.\\[2mm]

Also, please remember that each \instrument\ workflow supports only one mode.
For example, if the data consists entirely of polarimetric observations,
but any other workflow is executed, the Data Organiser actor will not
construct any datasets, showing the mentioned error message.
\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf The ``Select DataSets'' window displays my datasets, but
  some/all of them are greyed out. What is going on?}

If a dataset in the ``Select DataSets'' window is greyed out, then it
means that the dataset which was constructed is missing some key
calibration(s) (i.e. the dataset is incomplete). To find out what
calibration(s) are missing from a greyed out dataset, click on the
dataset in question to highlight it in blue, and then click on the
button \fbox{\tt Inspect Highlighted}. The ``Select Frames'' window
that appears will report the category of the calibration data that are missing (e.g. DARK). From this the user has then to
determine the missing raw data (in this case bias frames). If static
calibrations are missing the mechanism unfortunately does not work,
but such data should be found by {\tt reflex} in\\ {\tt
  <install\_directory>/calib/<pipeline\_version>/cal}

%\item {\bf I'm trying to reduce some old FORS2 data with the pipeline, but at
%the moment of running {\tt fors\_calib}, the arc lamp frame is not found.}

%The Reflex workflow with its default OCA rules works only for data
%taken after October 2006, when the calibration plan was changed. To
%process older data, right click on the {\tt DataOrganiser} to configure it,
%and change the OCA rules file to {\tt fors2\_spec\_wkf\_pre2006.oca} (same
%directory as the default OCA file), and  click on \fbox{\tt
%  Commit}.
