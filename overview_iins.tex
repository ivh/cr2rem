\section{\label{instrument}IIINSTRUMENT Instrument Description}


IIINSTRUMENT has been developed by ESO and the Max-Planck-Institut  für extraterrestrische 
Physik (MPE) in Garching. 

The instrument has been made available to the community and started 
operations in Paranal on April $1^{st}$, 2005.

In this chapter a brief description of the IIINSTRUMENT instrument is given.
A more complete documentation can be found in the IIINSTRUMENT User Manual,

\subsection{\label{instrument:overview}Instrument overview}

IIINSTRUMENT is a near-infrared (1.05 - 2.45 $\mu$m) integral field spectrograph 
(SPIFFI, developed by MPE) fed by an 
adaptive optics module (MACAO, developed by ESO, more details are given 
in [11]) .

An inside view of SPIFFI: The cryostat cover and the reinforcing structure 
have been removed to provide a free view on the opto-mechanical components 
of SPIFFI. The light enters from the top, and passes the sky-spider. The 
pre-optics with a filter-wheel and interchangeable lenses provides three 
different image scales. The image slicer re-arranges the two-dimensional field 
into a pseudo-long slit, which is perpendicular to the base plate. Three 
diamond turned mirrors collimate the light onto the gratings. In total, four 
gratings are implemented on the grating drive. A multiple-lens system then 
focuses the spectra on a Rockwell HAWAII array. The diameter of the instrument 
is 1.3m.

The spectrograph operates with 4 gratings (J, H, K, H+K) providing a spectral 
resolution around 2000, 3000, 4000 in J, H, K, respectively, and 1500 in H+K - 
each wavelength band fitting fully on the 2048 pixels of the Hawaii 2RG (2kx2k)
 detector in the dispersion direction. The IIINSTRUMENT field of view on the sky is 
sliced into 32 slices.
