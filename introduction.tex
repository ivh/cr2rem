\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

The \pipename\, pipeline is a subsystem of the 
{\it VLT Data Flow System} (DFS). It is used in two 
operational environements, for the ESO {\it Data Flow Operations} 
(DFO), and for the {\it Paranal Science Operations} (PSO), 
in the quick-look assessment of data, in the generation of master 
calibration data, in the reduction of scientific exposures, 
and in the data quality control. Additionally, the \pipename\, 
pipeline recipes are made public to the user community, to 
allow a more personalised processing of the data from the instrument. 
The purpose of this document is to describe a typical \pipename\, 
data reduction sequence with the \pipename\, pipeline.

This manual is a complete description of the data reduction recipes 
implemented by the the \pipename\, pipeline, reflecting the status 
of the \pipename\, pipeline as of \releasedate\, (version \pipelinevers).
