MANUAL:

WL are vacuum!

other extraction methods

expectation with calibs from calibdb. and own calibs.

wavecal, expectaions on absolute and relative performance.

util_extract --slit_frac is very handy!

use detlin for flat as well, when using for science, because blaze!

OTHER TODO: 
    check bpm in L and M

ask Yves:
    what about table with DPR/DO keys for all raw/
    util_plot works ?
    add smooth-spec to obs recipes and cal_flat, cal_wave?
    add extract_slit_frac to obs_staring?
    add --order to obs-recipes?
    default --oversample increase? can quick-look use different than default?

Tasks for Alexis/Linn/Ansgar
    compare normflat with and without detlin
    does oversample depend on height?

Comments for the pipeline manual draft.
Output - we have flux, error and wavelength per order and detector.

(1) If I remember correctly, the flux is per DIT (averaged over all exposures and NDITs) in ADU. The gain factor is not included. What about the error vector?

(2) It would be very helpful to have a formula of how to calculate the S/N ratio of a single exposure (DITxNDIT) using flux and error, and a formula of how to calculate the S/N of the combined spectrum (NEXPO x NABCYCLES).
