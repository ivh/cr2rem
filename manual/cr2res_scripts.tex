\section{Scripts}
\label{sec:scripts}

Included in the DRS are also a number of scripts. These do not perform necessary
actions and are not officially supported. Most are for visualization purposes
only. Nevertheless, they can serve as a starting point, for example for how to
open data products for further custom processing and analysis.

For the Python scripts, the only dependencies are \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{matplotlib} and \texttt{astropy.io.fits}. Shell scripts use bash-isms and might
or might not run in other shells.\footnote{Note that \texttt{/bin/sh} is not linked to \texttt{bash} on many modern linux-systems.}

A short description of the purpose and usage of each script will be Included
in a future version of this document. In the meantime taking a look at the source code needs to suffice.

\subsection{cr2res\_show\_raw.py}
Simply show raw (or calibrated) frames as a three-panel-plot. Cuts are chosen automatically unless given as first argument. Plots are saved as PNG-files with the same base name as the input.
\begin{shell}
    %prompt python3 show_raw.py 1,1000 somefile.fits another.fits
\end{shell}

\subsection{cr2res\_show\_trace.py}
Make a plot like Fig.~\ref{fig:flat_trace} by plotting the traces on top of any
frame, raw or otherwise.

\subsection{cr2res\_show\_trace\_curv.py}
Similar to previous, but also plots the slit-tilt in regular intervals. Examples can be seen in App.~\ref{sec:extrafigs}.

\subsection{cr2res\_update\_wl.py}
Update the wavelength columns in extracted spectra from a TW table.

\subsection{cr2res\_show\_spec\_catal.py}
Plot extracted spectra against a catalog of lines. Also has some key-bindings
to select regions from cursor and re-fit a wavelength solution.
