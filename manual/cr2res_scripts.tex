\section{Scripts}
\label{sec:scripts}

Included in the DRS are also a number of scripts. These do not perform necessary
actions and are not officially supported. Most are for visualization purposes
only. Nevertheless, they can serve as a starting point, for example for how to
open data products for further custom processing and analysis.

For the Python scripts, the only dependencies are \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{matplotlib} and \texttt{astropy.io.fits}.

A short description of the purpose and usage of each script will be Included
in a future version of this document. In the meantime taking a look at the source code needs to suffice.
