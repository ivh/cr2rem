\subsubsection{BPM in L and M}

The strong thermal emission present in the DARKs in L and M band makes the detection of bad pixels more difficult than in the shorter bands. It makes sense therefore to compare the derived BPM with one from e.g.~Y-band and vary the parameter \texttt{--bpm\_kappa}.

Simply using the BPM from another band has also been found to work well.
